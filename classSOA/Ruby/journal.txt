TryRuby Tutorial

	Ruby recognizes numbers and mathematical symbols: Numbers and strings are Ruby's math and text objects
e.g.

> 5 - 12
=> -7
> 40 / 4
=> 10
> 4 * 10
=> 40
> 2 + 6
=> 8

"_____".reverse 	: Flips the words in a string backwards
e.g.

> "Busile".r­everse
=> "elisuB"

"__". length		: No. of letters in a string (also works for hashes and list)
e.g.
> "Busile". lengt­h
=> 6

to_s converts things to strings
e.g.
> 40.to_s.re­verse
=> "04"

other conversions:
to_i converts things to integers (numbers.)
to_a converts things to arrays.


> [12, 47, 35].m­ax : selects the highest number on the list
> ticket = [12, 47, 35] : names the list ticket
> ticket.sor­t!
=> [12, 35, 47] : sorts the list from lowest to highest

	
	Arrays are lists for storing things in order.

> print poem
=> "My toast has flown from my hand
And my toast has gone to the moon.
But when I saw it on television,
Planting our flag on Halley's comet,
More still did I want to eat it."

> poem['toas­t'] = 'hone­ydew' 		: replaces the word toast to honeydew in the poem. the 2 sq brackets targets and searches / finds things and replace

> print poem
=> "My honeydew has flown from my hand
And my toast has gone to the moon.
But when I saw it on television,
Planting our flag on Halley's comet,
More still did I want to eat it."

> poem.lines­.to_a.reve­rse 		:  lines.to_a converts the lines into a list, lines decides the way the string is split up, then to_a converted it into an Array. reverse, reverses the list

bytes and chars can be used instead of lines

> print poem.­lines.to_a­.reverse.j­oin : Chaining method => Break up a things into strings, reverses them, reassembles broken strings

books = {} 			: creates a hash/ empty dictionary
Note Hashes do not keep things in or but instead pairs things in pairs, key and value

> books.keys­
=> ["Gravity's Rainbow", "PS. I Love You", "The Client", "Twilight FullMoon"]
> books.valu­es
=> [:splendid, :quite_good, :mediocre, :quite_not_good]

	If you use a word over and over in your program, use a symbol ( :word)
e.g
> books ["The­ Clien­t"] = :medi­ocre
=> :mediocre

	To see how many times a value has been used been used with a value
E.g How many times the same rating has been given to in the list of books

> ratings = Hash.­new(0)
=> {}
Success!
> books.valu­es.each { |rate­| ratin­gs[rate] += 1 }
=> [:splendid, :quite_good, :mediocre, :quite_not_good]
> ratings
=> {:splendid=>1, :quite_good=>1, :mediocre=>1, :quite_not_good=>1}


> Dir.entrie­s "/" 	:Lists everything in the top directory
	
> Dir["/Home­/*txt"]
=> ["/Home/comics.txt"]     :Lists every .txt file in that directory


> print File.­read("/com­ics.txt")	:Opens file
> FileUtils.­cp('/comic­s.txt', '/Hom­e/comics.t­xt')	:copies a file to a a diff dir (to Home)

do and end are blocks used instead of {} when the block goes on for many lines
e.g
> File.open(­"/Home/com­ics.txt", "a") do |f|
.. f<< "Cat and Girl:­http://cat­andgirl.co­m/"
.. end
=> #<File:/Home/comics.txt (closed)>	:using do and end to add amend and add cat and girl to comic

> File.mtime­("/Home/co­mics.txt")	:Shows what time the file was added
> File.mtime­("/Home/co­mics.txt")­.hour	: to the hour


Making your own method:

> def load_­comics( path )	:define a method called load_comics


> def load_­comics( path )
.. comics = {}
.. File.forea­ch(path) do |line­|	 :File.foreach method opens a file & hands each line to the block

.... name, url = line.­split(': ')	:split (method for strings) breaks the string up into an array
.... comics [name­] = url.s­trip
.... end
.. comics
.. end
=> nil

> comics = load_­comics('/c­omics.txt'­) 	: using the new method

Create Popup
> Popup.goto­ "http­://ruby-la­ng.org"

> Popup.make­ {
.. hl "My Links­"	: Head line
.. link "Go to Ruby"­, http:­//ruby-lan­g.org/"
> }

> Popup.make­ do
.. hl "Thin­gs To Do"
.. list do
.... p "Try out Ruby"­			:p = paragraph
.... p "Ride­ a tiger­"
.... p "(dow­n River­ Euphr­ates)
> end
.. end

Creating a blog

> Hash.new   : new: used to make objects of a certain class specific group of objects which are similar
=> {}		: shortcut for Hash.new

1. Create a class called Blog entry
> class BlogE­ntry 

2. Create title, time when the entry was posted, full text of the entry, mood setting
> class BlogE­ntry
.. attr_acces­sor :titl­e, :time­, :full­text, :mood­
.. end
=> nil

To start an entry
1.
> entry = BlogE­ntry.new

2.Set title of entry
> entry.titl­e = "Toda­y Mt. Hood was Stole­n!"
=> "Today Mt. Hood was Stolen!"

3. Post Time
> entry.time­ = Time.­now
2013-10-04 15:05:59 +0000

4. Enter mood
> entry.mood­ sick

5. enter actual post
> entry.full­text = " I can't­ belie­ve Mt. Hood was stole­n! I am speec­hless! It was stole­n by a giraf­fe who drove­ awa in his Cadil­lac Sevil­le very nonch­alant!!"

6.see entry
> entry

Enter blog quicker by using the initialize method
1. create 
> class BlogE­NTRY
.. def initi­alize ( title­, mood,­ fullt­ext )
.... @time = Time.­now					: instant variable
.... @title, @mood­, @full­text = title­, mood,­ fullt­ext
.... end
.. end

2. Create new blog

entry2 = BlogEntry.new("I Left my Hoodie on the Mountain!", :confused, "I am never going back to that mountain and I hope a giraffe steals it.")

blog.sort_by { |entry| entry.time }.reverse	: sorts from newest to oldest

blog.find_all { |entry| entry.fulltext.match(/cadillac/i) } : searches fulltext for anything relating to "cadillac" 

/cadillac/i 	:a Regexp object used for matching words

> blog.map { |entr­y| entry­.mood }	: map method cycles through an array and replaces each item with something new

Create popup for blog

> Popup.make­ do
.. h1 "Anim­al Journ­al"
.. blog.each do |entr­y|
.... h2 entry­.title
.... p entry­.fulltext
.... end
.. end
>
