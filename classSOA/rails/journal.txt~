it specifiess you want to use the interactive debugger debugger during development and testing but not in production

bundle install --without production
#checks if any gems specified in Gemfile are missing & need to be installed

Assignment 4.2
1. Create migration
rails generate migration create_movies
	
2. See file under db/migrate
    class CreateMovies < ActiveRecord::Migration

# method which takes a block of 1 arugument & produces to that block an object representing the table created.

      def up
        create_table 'movies' do |t|
          t.string 'title'
          t.string 'rating'
          t.text 'description'
          t.datetime 'release_date'
          # Add fields that let Rails automatically keep track
          # of when movies are added or modified:
          t.timestamps
        end
      end
     
      def down
        drop_table 'movies' # deletes the whole table and all its data!
      end
    end
3. Apply migration & create this table

rake db: migrate 

note: rake db:rollback #will undo the last migration by running its down method
